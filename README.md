# AMV-Workshop
Arduino code to be run on the RedBot SparkFun Inventor's Kit for the Autonomous Mining Vehicle Workshop.

There are four workshop activities described as follows:
Activity 1: Make the robot drive forward, turn left and right
- Challenge #1 (Easy) : Make the robot trace out a square
- Challenge #2 (Med)  : Make the robot move forward, do a U-turn then go forward
- Challenge #3 (Hard) : Make the robot trace out a circle
 
Activity 2: Make the robot stop when bumped or detect a different colour
- Challenge #1 (Easy) : Implement a unique horn to beep before the robot starts moving
- Challenge #2 (Med)  : Make the robot avoid and go around an obstacle in front of it
- Challenge #3 (Hard) : Get the RedBot through an obstacle course in the fastest time
 
Activity 3: Make the robot follow a straight and curved line
- Challenge #1 (Easy) : Make the robot stop for five seconds when sensing a loading point then move again
- Challenge #2 (Med)  : Make the robot stop and beep when encountering an obstacle
- Challenge #3 (Hard) : Upon detecting an obstacle, make the robot stop, beep, delay for five seconds, beep then move again
 
Activity 4: Make the robot follow a mining route, only stopping when it detects an obstacle in front of it with it's the bumper whiskers or a loading point (to simulate loading ore) before moving again.
